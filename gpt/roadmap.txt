1. Basic C Programming
Data Types & Structures: Familiarize yourself with basic data types (int, char, float, etc.) and structures (struct, enum).
Memory Management: Understand memory allocation (malloc, free) and pointers.
Control Flow: Practice loops, conditionals, and switch-case.
Input/Output: Practice reading and writing from files and standard I/O.
Task Example: Write a C program to implement a simple traffic light controller. The system should have three states: red, yellow, and green. Implement it using switch-case and a state machine pattern.

2. Bitwise Operations
Automotive systems often involve low-level operations where understanding bit manipulation is essential (e.g., working with hardware registers).

Bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT
Shifting bits (left and right)
Task Example: Write a C program that checks if the 3rd bit of a number is set. If itâ€™s set, the program should clear it; if not, it should set it.

3. Embedded C Concepts
If you're working in the automotive industry, chances are you'll need to know embedded systems programming, as much of the code runs on microcontrollers.

Interrupts and ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines)
Timers
Peripherals (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI)
Real-Time Systems: Understand basic concepts of RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems).
Task Example: Write a C function that simulates reading temperature data from a sensor via a GPIO pin. Based on the temperature value, control an LED to blink differently for low, medium, and high temperatures.

4. Control Algorithms
Automotive companies work with control systems, especially in areas like Engine Control Units (ECUs) and Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Understanding basic control algorithms will be helpful.

PID Controllers
Finite State Machines (FSM)
Task Example: Write a simple PID controller in C that adjusts the speed of a motor. Assume you have a target speed and a current speed, and the system should calculate the appropriate control signal.

5. Real-Time Constraints
Real-time systems are critical in the automotive industry. Systems need to be deterministic, meaning you must guarantee that tasks complete within a specified time.

Understand task scheduling
Critical sections and synchronization
Task Example: Write a C program that simulates two tasks running in a simple scheduler: one task reads sensor data, and another task processes that data. Each task should execute within fixed intervals (e.g., every 50 ms).

6. Diagnostics and CAN Communication
Automotive companies use the CAN (Controller Area Network) protocol to communicate between ECUs.

CAN Message Format
Message ID, DLC, and Data Field
Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC)
Task Example: Write a C function to send a CAN message containing engine RPM data. Simulate receiving and processing a CAN message for reading vehicle speed.

7. Coding Standards and Safety
Safety is crucial in the automotive industry. You'll need to know about coding standards like MISRA-C, which is used for writing safety-critical C code. Familiarize yourself with these standards:

MISRA-C guidelines
Defensive programming
Task Example: Review a piece of C code and identify potential MISRA violations. Rewrite the code to comply with the standard.

8. Debugging and Optimization
Automotive systems require optimized and reliable code. Be prepared to debug issues and optimize code for efficiency.

Profiling tools
Code size and execution time optimization
Stack and heap usage optimization
Task Example: Given a code snippet that uses nested loops for processing data, optimize the code to reduce execution time.

9. Understanding Automotive Standards
While you might not write safety-critical code from the start, understanding automotive safety standards like ISO 26262 is important. Focus on learning how these standards influence software development practices in the automotive industry.

10. Embedded System Tools
Familiarize yourself with tools that automotive companies commonly use for C development on embedded systems:

Compilers like GCC for cross-compiling
Debugging tools like GDB
Emulators and hardware debuggers
